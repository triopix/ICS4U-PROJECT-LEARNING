This course was purchased, and it is updated for 2023, so I will be learning the newest technologies and syntax. It doesn't teach react or any frontend framework, which fit my requirement to learn backend developement. Instead it just uses html css and javascript for the basic frontend framework and bootstrap to make the frontend components look good.

I am following this course from start to end. This course is divided into sections and is taught by Colt Steele. The first sections delve into html, css. Then we move on to in depth Javascript/Node/Express/ and learn about Bootstrap and other important things that are important for a backend developer. This course contains html/css/javascript Node/MongoDB/Express - which is perfect for me as I only want to focus on backend and server side (logic) dealing with database as well. This course is a full type of bootcamp that has numerous little quizzes, projects, and activities/excersizes which will make me extremely confident at the end to start with our own project. It will also accelerate the dev process once I am comfortable with these technologies. 

Every excersize, code, and eveyrthing else will be found here as concrete evidence, proof, and also a reference for others and myself in the future.
