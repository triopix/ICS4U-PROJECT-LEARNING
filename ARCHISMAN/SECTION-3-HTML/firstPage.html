    <!-- Don't put header tags in <p> tags as well-->
    <p>
      (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated junglefowl species, with
      attributes of wild species such as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl that
      are originally from Southeast Asia. Rooster and cock are terms for adult
      male birds, and a younger male may be called a cockerel.

    <h2>Terminology</h2>

    <p>
      An early domestication of chickens in Southeast Asia is probable, since
      the word for domestic chicken (*manuk) is part of the reconstructed
      Proto-Austronesian language (see Austronesian languages). Chickens,
      together with dogs and pigs, were the domestic animals of the Lapita
      culture,[26] the first Neolithic culture of Oceania.[27] The first
      pictures of chickens in Europe are found on Corinthian pottery of the 7th
      century BC.[28][29] Chickens were spread by Polynesian seafarers and
      reached Easter Island in the 12th century AD, where they were the only
      domestic animal, with the possible exception of the Polynesian rat (Rattus
      exulans). They were housed in chicken coops built from stone, which was
      first reported as such to Linton Palmer in 1868, who also "expressed his
      doubts about this".[
