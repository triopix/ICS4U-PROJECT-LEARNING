<h2>An <em>Introduction</em> </h2>

with attributes of wild species such as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl 
that are originally from Southeast Asia. Rooster and cock are terms for adult male birds, 
and a younger male may be called a cockerel.</p>

<h2>Terminology</h2>

<p>
    An early domestication of chickens in Southeast Asia is probable, since the word for domestic chicken (*manuk) is part of the reconstructed Proto-Austronesian language (see Austronesian languages). Chickens, together with dogs and pigs, were the domestic animals of the Lapita culture,[26] the first Neolithic culture of Oceania.[27]

The first pictures of chickens in Europe are found on Corinthian pottery of the 7th century BC.[28][29]

Chickens were spread by Polynesian seafarers and reached Easter Island in the 12th century AD, where they were the only domestic animal, with the possible exception of the Polynesian rat (Rattus exulans). They were housed in chicken coops built from stone, which was first reported as such to Linton Palmer in 1868, who also "expressed his doubts about this".[
